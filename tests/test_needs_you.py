"""Needs you shows only while the river waits on the owner; Autopilot otherwise (#297).

Before this, the board put Needs you where nothing waited on the owner: every time the done-whens checks finished on a
pull request (even one already merged), on closed issues a run stopped on after the owner had merged, and on parent
issues left with the pill from before their split was filed. A Needs you the river did set was wiped by the next new
commit, yet stayed for the whole run after the owner answered with a command. Nothing ever cleared old wrong pills.

Most tests fake dokima.board.Board and agent's `gh` against one in-memory world, so they read the board's end state:
each card's Status and Action ("Needs you", "Autopilot" or none), each item's labels and whether it is closed, each
issue's open pull request, sub-issues and history (the bot's records and the owner's words, read through
`gh issue view`). On top of test_autopilot_board's fake Board, the board offers two more reads the code is expected
to use:

    .state(kind, n) -> "open" | "closed"    a merged pull request is closed; raises subprocess.CalledProcessError
                                             when GitHub cannot say
    .cards() -> [{"kind", "number", "action", "closed", "autopilot"}, ...]
                                             every issue and pull request on the board: its Action ("Needs you",
                                             "Autopilot" or None), whether it is closed (merged counts) and whether
                                             it carries the autopilot label

Whether an item is closed may also be read through `gh` (`gh api repos/o/r/issues/N`, `gh issue view N --json state`,
`gh pr view N --json state`); the fake answers all of them alike, and fails alike for an item GitHub cannot read. A
pull request's issue is read from its branch (try/issue-N) or its "Closes #N". An item waits on the owner when the
river's last word on its issue stopped for the owner and no code owner has answered with a command since.
Code owners are the people CODEOWNERS names (dokima.plan.repo_approvers). Since #331 the pills follow the issue's
history, so each world holds the records and words behind them: a comment lands in the history before its event
reaches the board, a run's end is `agent board N OUT`, and a closed item shows no pill at all. The last two tests run
the real Board's new reads against a faked GitHub.

    """GitHub as the real Board reads it: a two-page project, issues and pull requests.

    Every query about the organization's project answers its id, its Status and Action fields and, page by page, its
    items: each with its id, type, content (number, state, closed, merged, labels, __typename), its Action value both as
    fieldValueByName and in fieldValues. The second page is answered when any variable or the query text carries the first page's endCursor.
    Every query about the repository answers the issue or pull request asked for, with its state; the REST reads of
    repos/dokima-dev/dokima/issues/N and pulls/N answer the same."""
