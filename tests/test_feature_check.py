"""The planner's check on a proposed split: every story is well formed and its dependencies form no loop.

Covers #156. A feature (a split into stories) reaches the owner only when every story has its title, user story,
acceptance criteria and a depends_on list, every criterion of a story has its text and source link, and every dependency points at another story of the same split with
no loop. Stories are named by their number counting from 1 ("story 2"), the way the split's card numbers them;
depends_on holds story indices counting from 0, the way /work files them as sub-issues.
