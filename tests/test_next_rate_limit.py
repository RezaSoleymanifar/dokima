"""Deciding what runs next says why GitHub failed, and waits out its rate limit (#417).

agent.yml runs `python3 -m dokima.agent next N OUT` as `NEXT=$(...) || NEXT=stop`, so before #417 a GitHub call that
failed inside it (on 10-10, "GraphQL: API rate limit already exceeded for installation ID ...") became a stop with no
Next line and no word on the issue. These tests run the same `next` command in-process on a passed planner record,
whose decision is to start the plan reviewer, against a fake GitHub that stands in for `dokima.agent.gh`:

- `gh issue view` gives the issue and its comments, `gh pr list` gives no pull requests, and `gh api rate_limit`
  gives GitHub's rate limit answer (`resources.graphql.reset` and `resources.core.reset`, epoch seconds), the one
  call GitHub answers even when the limit has run out.
- A fake clock replaces `time.time`, and `time.sleep` only moves it forward, so a wait of an hour takes no time.
- Every other call fails, the way gh fails (CalledProcessError with GitHub's words on stderr), while the fake clock
  is before the reset of the limit that ran out, or always, or never, as each test says.

What the run decided is what `next` printed (the workflow reads it as NEXT) and the Next line it added to the
record (OUT/comment.md, which the workflow posts on the issue); OUT/board.txt says whether the card shows Needs you.
So the fakes reach the code, `next` reads GitHub only through `dokima.agent.gh` and reads the clock and waits only
through `time.time()` and `time.sleep()`.
