"""Every agent's hand-back raises and answers through two fields, and nothing raised is skipped (#300).

The owner wants the planner, the worker and the reviewer to raise what they judge only as raises (a question, a
blocker or an issue, dokima/raises.py from #298) and to answer what was raised to them only as answers, with every
old field for this gone; each agent starts with the exact list it must answer, and code rejects a hand-back that
skips one; the river routes by raises; and on autopilot the reviewer may answer a planner's question for the owner
only with the owner's own words, checked by code.

What the code these tests run must do, as the plan pins it:
- The old fields are questions, concerns, replies, suspect_tests, outside_scope, blockers, notes, assumptions,
  issues_found, outside_plan and resolved. A planner hand-back (`python3 -m dokima.planner check N OUT`, a story or a
  split) or a worker or reviewer hand-back (`python3 -m dokima.agent check work|review FILE PLAN N`) holding any of
  them, even empty, is rejected with a reason naming each one it holds. Its "raises" are checked with
  raises.check_raises for its role; "raises" and "answers" are lists and may be left out when empty.
- A review that blocks raises at least one blocker; one that approves raises none.
- `python3 -m dokima.agent record ROLE STAGE OUT CHECK PASSED LOGS` stamps the hand-back's raises in record.json
  (raises.stamp): each gets "raised_by" and an ID that no raise or old blocker in the records of $PACK/in/ has.
- `agent.pack(repo, n, role, stage, dest)` writes dest/open_blockers.json: exactly the raises still open on the issue
  whose raises.sent_to is that role, oldest first, each as stamped. A raise is open from the passed record that
  raised it until a passed record answers its ID. Before this change a review listed "blockers"; the open ones of
  the newest review at each stage (unless it approved, and unless a later record answered or replied to them by ID)
  are listed as raises {"kind": "blocker", "to": its fixer, "raised_by": "reviewer", "id": its old ID, "text": holding
  its problem}.
- `python3 -m dokima.agent check-round ROLE FILE PACK` exits 1 and names the ID of every raise in
  PACK/open_blockers.json that the hand-back's "answers" leave unanswered, and rejects an answer that is not done or
  disagree with a why; it exits 0 when every one is answered. A reviewer may also answer a question for the owner
  still open in the records of PACK/in/: that answer carries "words" (the owner's words), "source" (where they said
  them: the issue's link, one of its comments' links or AGENTS.md) and "changes" (true or false: whether the reading
  changes how the system works or what it costs), or the check rejects it.
- `agent.next_step` routes a review by its raises: any blocker for the planner starts the planner, blockers only for
  the worker start the worker, and any question or blocker for the owner stops; a planner's blocker for the owner
  stops, and its question stops off autopilot and goes to the plan reviewer on autopilot. On autopilot, a plan review
  lets the plan go on only when it answered each of the plan's questions done, with changes false and with words
  the owner really said where the source says; otherwise it stops and names the question left.
- dokima/roles/planner.md, worker.md and reviewer.md each hold one section headed exactly "# Raising and answering",
  running to the next line that starts with "# " or the end of the file, word for word the same in all three.
