"""Tests for #282: one manifest in code declares everything Dokima needs from GitHub.

The manifest is `dokima/manifest.py`, plain data read without a network:
    LABELS        {label name: {"color": "rrggbb", "description": str}}
    FIELDS        {board field name: {option name: {"color": GitHub option color, "description": str}}}
    VIEWS         {view name: {"layout": "table" | "board" | "roadmap", "filter": str}}
    CHECKS        [required check name, ...]
    BRANCH_RULES  {branch name: {"required_checks": [check name, ...], ...}}
    PERMISSIONS   {app permission: "read" | "write"}, the same as dokima/app.json's default_permissions
    undeclared(root) -> [str, ...]: one line per setting the code or workflows under `root` rely on that the manifest
        leaves out, naming the setting and the file (path relative to root, with forward slashes). It reads the
        manifest's data when called, so a test can take an entry out and see the guard report it.

What counts as relying on a setting:
    label       a workflow started by it (github.event.label.name == '...'), or code adding it ("labels[]": "...",
                labels[]=...)
    field       code setting it: board.set(iid, "Field", "Option"); the option counts too
    view        code adding it: add_view("Name", ...)
    check       code looking a check run up by name: r["name"] == "..." or r["name"] == NAME, where NAME = "..." in that
                file (a name subscripted once, so p["label"]["name"] == "plan" is a label, not a check)
    branch rule code reading a branch's rule: branches/<branch>/protection or rules/branches/<branch>
    permission  a workflow asking an app token for it (permission-<name>: <level>), or code calling
                branches/<branch>/protection, which needs administration: read to read it, write to change it
                (-X PUT/POST/PATCH/DELETE, or rest("PUT", ...)); a level higher than the manifest's is left out too

The app's permission behind every GitHub call (282.4): the guard also names every GitHub call whose app permission, at
the level it needs, the manifest leaves out, with the permission and the file. The calls it sees:
    in Python under dokima/: gh("api", [-X METHOD,] PATH, ...) and rest/api/self.rest(METHOD, PATH, ...), where PATH is
        written in the call (a string or f-string); without -X, a gh api call with -f/-F fields is POST, else GET;
        gh("<command>", "<subcommand>", ...) for gh's other commands; and every GraphQL query or mutation written in
        the code (a string starting "query" or "mutation"). A wrapper passing on a path it was given is not a call.
    in workflows: gh and git push in a step whose GH_TOKEN (or a token in a git URL) is an app token
        (steps.<id>.outputs.token); a step running on github.token uses Actions' own key, not the app's.
GET and GraphQL queries need read; POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, mutations, git push and gh commands that change
something need write. Calls that need no permission (users/<login>, installation/token) are quiet. A call the guard
cannot tie to a permission is named too, with its file, so a new kind of call never slips through.
