"""A clash with main is re-planned once, on autopilot only, then rebuilt (#369).

On 2026-10-09 PR #323 clashed with main, and every later merge sent issue #284 back to its planner again: the re-plan
passed review but nothing rebuilt the pull request, so the clash stayed and the next merge started the same round.
These tests hold the owner's rule: a clash starts the planner by itself only on autopilot; off autopilot the issue says
it needs a re-plan and waits for `/plan`; a clash already sent back and not rebuilt since (no worker record after the
newest clash record) is not sent back again; and an approved clash re-plan goes to the worker on autopilot, or stops
for the owner saying `/work` rebuilds the pull request off autopilot.

`dokima.uptodate.clash(repo, base, sha, pr, rest=..., files=..., owners=...)` is driven with the in-process fake
GitHub from test_clash.py, which also answers GET repos/o/r/issues/N with the issue's labels (autopilot is the issue's
own `autopilot` label) or GitHub's refusal. The river is `dokima.agent.next_step`; the card is `dokima.card.status`.
