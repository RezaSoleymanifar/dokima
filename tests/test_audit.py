"""Tests for #283: the drift audit reports on one pinned Setup issue, else stays silent.

The audit is `dokima/audit.py`. It compares the manifest (`dokima/manifest.py`) with the repo's live settings and
reports the difference on one Setup issue. Everything it reads from or writes to GitHub goes through one object it is
given, so these tests hand it a faked GitHub kept in memory. What the audit is expected to offer:

    audit.compare(github, repo) -> [str, ...]
        one plain line per setting that differs from the manifest or could not be read; empty when all match
    audit.run(github, repo, root=".") -> issue number or None
        compares, then reports on the Setup issue: opens it (pinned, Needs you) or updates the open one when something
        is off; closes an open one with one line when nothing is; does nothing at all when nothing is off and none is
        open. Code owners are read from root/.github/CODEOWNERS. Returns the Setup issue it touched, or None.

What the faked GitHub offers, and the audit is expected to use (a read may raise subprocess.CalledProcessError, as
`gh` does, carrying GitHub's reason in stderr):
    labels(repo)              {name: {"color": "rrggbb", "description": str}}
    fields()                  the board's {field: {option: {"color": COLOR, "description": str}}}
    views()                   the board's {view: {"layout": str, "filter": str}}
    branch_rule(repo, branch) {"required_checks": [name, ...]}, or None when the branch has no rule
    permissions(repo)         the app's {permission: "read" | "write"}
    setup_issue(repo)         the open Setup issue as {"number": n, "body": str}, or None
    create_issue(repo, title, body) -> n
    edit_issue(repo, n, body)
    comment(repo, n, text)
    close_issue(repo, n)
    pin_issue(repo, n)
