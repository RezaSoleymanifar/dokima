"""The sandbox play-through checks both cards after every step, from new issue to merge (#437).

#419: the code review had passed, yet the card said Code review running for 30 minutes. The review's record is the
bot's edit of its live run card, and card.yml skips every edit the bot makes, so nothing redrew the card. The fake
GitHub of tests/card_player.py plays card.yml one event at a time, but only a run on real GitHub proves what the owner
sees. So `python3 -m dokima.playthrough`, started by .github/workflows/playthrough.yml's Run workflow button, plays
one issue on dokima-dev/card-gallery with stand-in agents that call no model, and judges both cards after each step.

These tests run with no GitHub and no key. They prove the parts that decide the verdict: the steps in order, the
judge of each step's cards (drawn by dokima/card.py), the #419 moment replayed through today's card.yml, the wait
that fails a hung step, the guard that keeps the play-through on the sandbox, the stand-in agents' empty usage, and
the workflow's button, key and permissions.
