"""The issue card and the planner's run comment show the links, each with its icon.

Issue #251, story 2 of #231. The planner hands back `links`: three lists of open issue numbers, `blocked_by`, `blocks` and `relates_to` (#250).
This story draws them. Each kind with at least one link gets one line: its fixed field icon from card.FIELD_ICONS
("blocked by" -> blocked-by.svg, "blocks" -> blocks.svg, "related" -> related.svg, all added by #234), right in front
of its label (Blocked by, Blocks, Relates to), then its issue numbers as #N. A kind with no links has no line, and an
older plan with no links field draws exactly as one with three empty lists.

The issue card (dokima/card.py render, on the issue and on its pull request) draws them from the newest plan. The
planner's run comment no longer shows them: the owner keeps the links on the card at the top of the page (#236).
