"""Once a build has started, the card says Work and stops asking for /work.

Issue #439, story 3 of #425.
Before this, dokima/card.py status() placed the card from the newest record alone. After a plan review approved, it
said Plan with Needs you: Say /work to build the plan until the worker's record arrived, even while the worker was
building. The board already follows AGENTS.md (The board): a build starts with a code owner's `/work`, the bot's line
`Autopilot: plan approved, starting work` or the worker's run card, and the same words from anyone else start nothing.
These tests hold the issue card and the PR card to that same rule. They use test_card_status's in-memory history:
records the bot posted and comments, drawn with card.render on the issue page and on the pull request page.
