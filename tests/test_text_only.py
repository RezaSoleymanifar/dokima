"""A pull request changing only text files skips the plan and its tests (issue #358).

Most tests here run the real command the done-whens workflow runs, `python3 -m dokima.checks matrix`, from the repo
root, with GitHub faked: a stub `gh` on PATH answers the pull request's changed files (GitHub's `pulls/N/files` list,
split over two pages the way `gh api --paginate` prints them back to back) and finds no issue linked and no plan.
Others run the shell of the done-whens workflow's own steps, cut out of `.github/workflows/done-whens.yml`, with a fake
`pytest` on PATH, so the workflow GitHub runs is the thing judged. Nothing here touches the network.

Text files are `.md` files outside `dokima/roles/`, `tests/` and `.github/`: AGENTS.md, README.md, the wiki under
docs/wiki/ and any other Markdown file. Anything else changed sends the pull request the full way.
