"""The Definition of Done shows Code review and All tests running while they run (#372).

Seen on #367: All tests had passed and the code review had been running for a minute, yet the card still said Code
review "not started". dokima/card.py's code_review() knew only a finished review, and card.yml skipped the bot's own
comments, so the review's live run card never redrew the card; and card.yml redrew only when the full suite finished,
never when it started.

The first test draws the card from records and comments alone, through dokima/card.py's render(). The others play
card.yml for one event at a time against a fake GitHub with tests/card_player.py, and read the cards it leaves on
issue #246 and its PR #260.
