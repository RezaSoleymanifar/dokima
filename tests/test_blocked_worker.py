"""On autopilot, a blocked issue plans only after its blockers merge (#353, which reverses #253).

Before #353 a blocked issue on autopilot planned early, and its approved plan waited for its blockers with the bot's
line `Autopilot: plan approved, waiting for #A to close`; when they closed, its worker built that old plan, with
`Autopilot: blockers closed, starting work`. A plan written while its blockers are still open goes stale when they
merge, so now nothing waits with an approved plan. Each moment runs the real code against a fake GitHub:

- The plan review approves. `python3 -m dokima.agent next N OUT` (the step of agent.yml that decides what follows a
  run) runs on the review's record, on the fake GitHub of test_plan_links_recorded.py (issue #252 there). An issue on
  autopilot that GitHub still has blocked by an open issue builds nothing: no worker starts, no line stands in for
  `/work`, and the card's Next line names the open issues it waits for and says it plans again, mentioning no one.
- An issue closes. autopilot.yml runs the way GitHub runs it, on the machine of test_autopilot_close.py (issue #57
  there). When the last open blocker of such an issue closes, autopilot starts a fresh planner run once, with
  `Autopilot: blockers merged, starting plan`, and never the worker of the old plan.
- A command the owner types by hand runs as today, through commands.yml, and a later close never overrides it.

Where GitHub cannot list an issue's blockers, the fake answers that read with "HTTP 502: Server Error" and nothing
may start, with GitHub's reason on the issue.
