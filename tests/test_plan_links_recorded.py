"""Once a plan passes review, code records its links and redraws both cards (#252).

Story 3 of #231.

The planner's plan.json carries `links`: three lists of open issue numbers, `blocked_by`, `blocks` and `relates_to`.
When the plan reviewer approves the plan, `python3 -m dokima.agent next N OUT` (the step of agent.yml that decides
what follows a run, given the run's record in OUT/record.json) records them: each blocked_by link as GitHub's own
blocked-by link on this issue, each blocks link as the other issue blocked by this one, and it removes a blocking link
the previous approved plan had and the new one dropped. Then it redraws the card of this issue and of every issue a
link was added to or dropped from, so the other issue's card shows the link from its own side. Relates to has no
GitHub link and no comment is ever posted for it; how the other card learns of it is the worker's choice, but the
link must still show after that card is redrawn again by `python3 dokima/card.py` (card.yml's own redraw).

When recording would make issues block each other, directly or through other issues, nothing is recorded and the
river stops for the owner, saying which issues. When GitHub refuses a link, the river stops and says which link and why.

Every test runs the real commands as subprocesses against a fake GitHub: a `gh` program put first on PATH that keeps
its state in one JSON file (issues with their bodies, comments and labels, and blocked-by links) and logs every call.
It answers what Dokima calls today: `gh issue view/comment/edit`, `gh pr list`, and `gh api` for issues
(GET and PATCH), their events, comments, sub-issues, the GraphQL issue query of dokima/plan.py, pulls, contents
(only .github/CODEOWNERS exists), worker runs, commits, dispatches, and GitHub's REST dependency endpoints:
GET repos/o/r/issues/N/dependencies/blocked_by and .../blocking, POST .../blocked_by -F issue_id=<the blocker's id>,
DELETE .../blocked_by/<the blocker's id>. Any other call fails, the way an unknown GitHub path does.
