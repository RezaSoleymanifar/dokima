"""A new issue shows the owner's text first, then the Definition of Done, with no "no plan yet".

Issue #371. The owner asked (2026-10-09) that when an issue is first posted and has no plan yet, the Definition of
Done line no longer comes before the owner's original issue text: it moves below that text, and the line "This issue
has no plan yet." goes away. Since #407 the owner's text shows open below the card's marker until the issue has a plan,
so on an issue with no plan the body reads: the card's status and link lines, the owner's text, then the Definition of
Done. Once the issue has a plan, the card is drawn as before, with the Definition of Done at its bottom, above the
owner's text in its closed Original issue fold.

The card is drawn by dokima/card.py render and saved by card.draw through dokima/body.py, which keeps the owner's text
byte for byte or refuses. These tests run card.draw with GitHub faked by the recorder in tests/test_body.py, and read
the body it saves the way the owner reads the issue.
