"""A blocked-by link added or removed by hand shows on both cards (#254).

Story 5 of #231.

GitHub Actions has no event for a blocked-by link being added or removed, so, as the owner answered on #254, the cards
update on every event GitHub does announce on either issue, with a schedule only as a backstop. card.yml runs
`python3 dokima/card.py` on every issues and issue_comment event a person causes on an issue (ISSUE_NUMBER is that
issue, GITHUB_EVENT_NAME issues or issue_comment): it redraws that issue's card and the card of every issue it blocks
or is blocked by, on GitHub now or on its card before, so a link removed by hand leaves the other card too. card.yml
also runs on a cron (GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=schedule, no ISSUE_NUMBER), and then card.py sweeps every open issue. Both read
GitHub's own blocked-by links (GET repos/o/r/issues/N/dependencies/blocked_by and .../blocking) and rewrite another
issue's card only when its blocking links, or loop of issues blocking each other, differ from what its card shows.
Every redraw draws the Blocked by and Blocks lines from GitHub's links read right then.

Every test runs the real `python3 dokima/card.py` as a subprocess against the fake GitHub of
tests/test_plan_links_recorded.py (a `gh` first on PATH keeping its state in one JSON file), extended here with two
things: GitHub failing to list one issue's blocked-by links (state "unreadable": {issue: GitHub's error}), and a
project board reached through dokima.board.Board's own GraphQL calls, as DOKIMA_BOARD="o/1" names it, whose Action
writes are logged as {"op": "field", "item": "ITEM_issue_N", "field": "Action", "option": "Needs you" or None}.
The sweep lists open issues with `gh api repos/o/r/issues`, which the fake answers. card.yml itself is read as text:
its triggers, and its job's one-line `if:` evaluated against the events GitHub would send.
