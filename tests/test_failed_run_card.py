"""A failed run puts its card in Needs you, in the column of the stage that ran (#132).

Two layers. The first runs the agent workflow (.github/workflows/agent.yml) step by step the way GitHub runs it, using
the machine from tests/test_start.py, with a board set (vars.DOKIMA_BOARD), so its "Move the card on the board" step
really runs `python3 -m dokima.agent board`. The fake `gh` also answers the board's GraphQL calls and records every
field it sets, so each test reads back where the card ended up: its Status column and whether it shows Needs you. The
fake Claude Code can be told to crash, and the fake `gh` can be told to fail every read of the issue once the agent
has started, which is how the run's own "Decide what follows" step fails in real life (GitHub answering 502).

The second layer runs `python3 -m dokima.agent board N OUT` alone, the way the board step does, with a fake `gh` on
PATH: when the run left no decision behind (no board.txt, or nothing at all in OUT), the card must still land in the
column of the stage the run was for, with Needs you.
