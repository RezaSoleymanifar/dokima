"""Every issue and pull request a card names shows as GitHub's own reference.

Issue #359. GitHub draws a reference to an issue, a pull request or a comment on one with its status icon, its title
and its number, but only when the markdown leaves the reference bare: `#N`, or the page's own link written out on
its own (`https://github.com/o/r/issues/N`, `.../pull/N`, `.../issues/N#issuecomment-M`). A reference wrapped in a
link of its own, `[issue #40](...)` or `<a href="...">Source</a>`, shows only the wrapped words, with no icon and no
title. These tests draw cards with `dokima/card.py`, and the agents' run comments with `dokima/agent.py`, and read
the markdown: every issue or pull request a card or run comment names must be a bare reference, and none may sit
inside a link with words of its own. A link around an image only (a verdict circle linked to its proof) names
nothing and is left alone, as are links to other pages: the latest run, the files changed, a test, AGENTS.md.
