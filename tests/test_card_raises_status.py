"""Raises leave the card; its status line says what needs the owner (#455).

Story 4 of #416. The owner wants the card to stop listing raises: questions, blockers and issues found stay only in
the run comment that raised them. When the river stops for questions or blockers sent to the owner, the card's status
line says so with the count, such as "Needs you: answer 2 questions", and those words link to the comment that raised
them. A plan whose questions are raises (not the retired `questions` field, #401) shows that to-do instead of "See the
newest record below", and the same raise is counted once however many records carry it (#388's card showed one
question twice). It is checked on GitHub's own rendering of the card too, not only on the raw text.

What the code these tests run must do, as the plan pins it:
- `card.render(repo, issue, found, page)` draws no Raised section, no raise's text or label and no raise icon
  (question, blocker, issue found) on the issue's or the pull request's card.
- When the river stops on a record because it raised questions or blockers for the owner (a planner's or a review's),
  the status line reads "Needs you: " and then a link whose words are exactly "answer N question(s)", "answer N
  blocker(s)" or "answer N question(s) and M blocker(s)", whose target is the address ("url") of the comment that
  holds that record, as dokima.agent.conversation lists it; the words after the link are free.
- A raise is counted once: the same raise carried by two records (the same ID, or the same kind and words) is one.
- Any other stop keeps its to-do as today, and a run that raised nothing for the owner shows no such link.

How the tests read a card: the status line is the line inside the card that opens with the stage in bold, icons
allowed in front. A link is markdown `[words](url)` or HTML `<a href="url">words</a>`. GitHub's rendering comes from
tests/github_rendering.json: the answers of GitHub's markdown API for the exact card text, as #452 records them,
refreshed with `python3 tests/record_rendering.py`.
