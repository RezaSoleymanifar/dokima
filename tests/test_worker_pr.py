"""A finished worker always ends with its pull request open, even when it has nothing new to push (#257).

On #244 the planner had already pushed the whole fix, the worker had nothing new, the push step quit early and the
pull request was never opened. These tests run the real steps of .github/workflows/agent.yml that take a finished
run's work to GitHub, with the machine from test_start.py (a temp repo whose origin is a local bare repo, a fake
`gh` that records every call): copying the runtime, checking out try/issue-57, minting the app's key, then every step
from that key up to saving the conversation. The hand-back is taken as passed (PASSED=true), the way the run sets it
once the code's check accepts it. A pull request is opened when the fake `gh` is asked `gh pr create` for the head
try/issue-57; options.json's pr_open makes #60 already open for it.
