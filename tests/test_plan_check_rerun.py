"""An approved plan runs the pull request's plan check again on its current head (#295).

The plan check is the done-whens workflow (.github/workflows/done-whens.yml): its `list` job reads the issue's records
and builds one check per criterion of the approved plan, and its gate, "all done-whens passed", fails with "No approved
plan found" while the newest plan has no approving review. It runs only when the pull request gets a new commit, so a
plan re-approved with nothing new to push kept its stale failure.

These tests run the whole agent workflow (agent.yml) for the plan reviewer on issue #57, whose pull request #60 is
open on try/issue-57, on the machine of test_start.py: every step's `if:` is evaluated and its script runs with bash
against a fake `gh`. The fake Claude Code hands back the review the test chose. Nothing is pushed by a plan review, so
the pull request's head stays the commit the test made: a re-approval with no new commit.

The fake GitHub of test_start.py is taught pull request #60 and GitHub Actions runs. Runs live in runs.json, each
{id, name, path, event, head_sha, head_branch, status, conclusion, run_attempt, matrix, reruns}. It answers:
  - `gh pr view 60|try/issue-57 --json ...` (number, headRefName, headRefOid, body, state, url, comments, reviews) and
    `gh api repos/o/r/pulls/60` (number, state, body, head.sha, head.ref), with -q/--jq a plain `.field` or `.head.sha`;
  - the runs: `gh api repos/o/r/actions/runs` and `repos/o/r/actions/workflows/done-whens.yml/runs` (the file name or
    the path), filtered by the query's head_sha, branch, event and status, newest first, as {total_count,
    workflow_runs}; `gh api repos/o/r/actions/runs/ID`; and `gh run list` with --workflow, --commit, --branch,
    --status, -L/--limit and --json (databaseId, headSha, status, conclusion, workflowName, event, number, attempt);
  - a re-run: `gh api -X POST repos/o/r/actions/runs/ID/rerun` or `.../rerun-failed-jobs`, and `gh run rerun ID`
    (with or without --failed).
A whole re-run runs the plan check again the way GitHub would: the fake runs Dokima's own `python3 -m dokima.checks
matrix` for pull request #60 against the fake GitHub as it is at that moment, and the gate passes exactly when the
plan check lists criteria and every one of them has a test (each test's own result is not what these tests judge).
Re-running only the failed jobs keeps the matrix the first attempt listed, as GitHub keeps a passed job's outputs, so
the gate fails again. GitHub refuses a re-run of a run that is still going ("HTTP 403: This workflow is already
running"), one asked with the workflow's own token, which agent.yml gives only read access ("HTTP 403: Resource not
accessible by integration"), and every re-run when the test made it refuse.
