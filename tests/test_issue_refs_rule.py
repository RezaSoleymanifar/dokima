"""AGENTS.md tells agents to name an issue with a link and a few plain words.

Issue #355 asks for a rule in AGENTS.md: whenever an agent or assistant refers the owner to an issue or pull request,
it writes the number as a clickable link followed by a few plain words saying what it is about, never a bare number,
with the owner's example. These tests read AGENTS.md and look for one paragraph or bullet that states the whole rule,
and for the example as a real markdown link. Matching ignores case, line breaks and repeated spaces inside a
paragraph, so the worker may wrap lines freely.
