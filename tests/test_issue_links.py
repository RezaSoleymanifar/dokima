"""The planner finds the open issues this one is blocked by, blocks or relates to, and code checks them.

Issue #250 (story 1 of #231). The planner's starting pack holds the repo's open issues; its prompt tells it to find the
links; its hand-back carries them in a `links` field of three lists; and the round check every planner run does
(`python3 -m dokima.agent check-round planner FILE PACK`) rejects a missing or malformed field, a number that is not
one of the open issues in the pack, a link to the issue itself and one issue in two of the lists.

GitHub is faked: `gh issue view` and `gh pr list` answer for issue 250, and the repo's open issues are served to both
ways of listing them, `gh issue list` (which honours `--limit`/`-L`, 30 by default, as gh does) and
`gh api repos/o/r/issues` (which pages at `per_page`, 30 by default, unless `--paginate` is given, and also lists pull
requests, each with a `pull_request` key, as GitHub's API does). Any other GitHub call fails the test naming it.
