"""A split story may cite the owner's words in its parent issue (#334).

On #331 the planner linked its criteria to #330, the parent where the owner wrote them, and code rejected the plan
twice: a source had to be the story's own issue or one of its comments. These tests hold code to the new rule: a
criterion's source may be the story's own issue, its parent issue (GitHub's native sub-issue parent), or a comment
on either; any other issue is still rejected, naming the criterion and the source; and the reviewer's check that the
owner's words were really said there accepts the parent too.

How the parent reaches each check:
- The starting pack (`python3 -m dokima.agent pack N ROLE STAGE DEST`, built while the run holds a GitHub key) writes
  `parent.json` holding {"number": P}, P the issue's parent on GitHub. With no parent, or when GitHub cannot say,
  parent.json is absent or holds {"number": null}.
- The planner's check (`python3 -m dokima.planner check N OUT`) and the plan review's check (`python3 -m dokima.agent
  check review FILE PLAN N`) hold no key: they read parent.json from the pack named by $PACK (the plan review's
  check also finds it beside PLAN, which sits in the pack).
- The river (`python3 -m dokima.agent next N OUT`) asks GitHub for the parent and its words itself.

GitHub is faked by a `gh` on PATH. It answers the parent the ways GitHub gives it: REST `repos/o/r/issues/N/parent`
(the parent issue, or 404 when there is none), and GraphQL queries naming `parent` (repository.issue.parent with its
number, title, body, url and comments). The parent's words come from `gh issue view P`, REST `repos/o/r/issues/P` and
`repos/o/r/issues/P/comments`, or that GraphQL answer. With fail_parent set, every parent lookup fails as GitHub
does (HTTP 502).
