"""Run comments show only what carries weight for that step, with no codes (#236).

A run comment is what code posts when a planner, worker or reviewer run ends: `agent record ROLE STAGE OUT CHECK PASSED
LOGS` in dokima/agent.py writes OUT/record.json and OUT/comment.md. These tests draw comments with `agent.render`, and
run that command the way the workflow does (from the run's checkout, with $PACK, $BASE and $N set), then read the
comment the way the owner does. Every hand-back here has the shape the agents' prompts give today: raises and answers,
never a field retired by #300.

    a review            is called Plan review or Code review everywhere
    the planner's       never repeats the issue card (user story, criteria, scope, out of scope, tests, links); it
                        shows its sentence, its raises, its answers and its changes to older tests
    a review's          opens with passed, blocked or escalated, then each failing criterion of the plan (its sentence
                        behind the failed circle, each blocker's words behind the blocker icon, then its Source), then
                        each ask nothing covers, then Raised: its blockers, its questions, then its issues
    the worker's        shows the files it changed since $BASE as links on one line, never its per-criterion sentences
    answers             of the planner and the worker show in the same Raised earlier section as a review's
    every comment       ends with its stats on one line, the last of the comment (#454), below the Full record
                        fold, which stays the last fold; token counts read short (950, 12K, 3M)

"Visible" below means the comment without its Full record fold: the record holds every ID and number by design.
