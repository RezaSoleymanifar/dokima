"""A plan review lists every ask of the owner, and real hand-backs are kept as samples that pass their checkers.

The planner writes the criteria from the owner's words, so it cannot check itself for an ask it dropped. The reviewer
reads the issue on its own and hands back an asks list in review.json: each ask in the owner's words, a link to where
they said it, and the plan's criterion it maps to, or "missing". Code rejects a plan review without that list, and a
plan review that marks an ask missing cannot approve.

Every check here runs the real commands the workflow runs on a review (`agent check review FILE PLAN N`, then
`agent check-round reviewer FILE PACK`) on a starting pack built in a temp folder, with STAGE set as the workflow's job
sets it: a plan review's pack, or a code review's pack, which also holds the PR's diff. A plan for issue 9 with criteria 9.1 to 9.3 stands in for the plan.
