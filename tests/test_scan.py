"""One scan names every card that does not match its issue's state now (#333).

Story 3 of #330. The owner's test of #330: after it ships, a scan of the whole board finds no closed card outside Done
or with a pill, no open card in the wrong column, and the PR cards of #246 and #312 show Merged with every check passed.
This scan is that test, made a command the owner can run any time:

    DOKIMA_BOARD=org/number REPO=owner/name python3 -m dokima.scan

It prints one line for each card that does not match its state, naming it ("issue #N" or "PR #N") and saying what is
wrong, then exits 1; when every card matches, it prints `All N cards on the board match their state.` (N the number of
issue and pull request cards it checked) and exits 0. It only reads: it never moves a card, sets a pill or edits a body.

How the tests run it. dokima.scan.main() is called in-process with DOKIMA_BOARD and REPO set; it returns the exit code
(or raises SystemExit with it). GitHub is faked in one World:
- dokima.board.Board is replaced by a fake whose cards() lists every issue and pull request card as
  {kind, number, status, action, closed, autopilot}, as the real Board.cards() does on main (#339). Every write the
  fake board offers (set, label, add_view, set_view_filter, and item() for something not on the board) is logged.
- The `gh` helper of every dokima module that has one (dokima.agent, dokima.body, dokima.card, dokima.plan, and
  dokima.scan if it defines its own) answers from the World: issues and pull requests with their state, body, records
  and checks, the `gh api` REST reads the card code makes, and the GraphQL issue and closing-issue queries. Writes are
  logged. A call the fake does not know fails loudly, naming the call, so a test that fails on it says why.
The column an open card's state gives is the one the board code puts it in now (dokima.board.where, #339): no record is
Backlog, a plan waiting for /work or sent back to the planner is Plan, an approving code review is Review, and a pull
request follows its issue. A closed issue or a merged or closed pull request belongs in Done with no pill
(dokima.board.DONE).
The card a state gives is the one Dokima's card code writes when it redraws the issue now (dokima.card.draw, the part
above the marker, the same on the PR); dokima.scan.card_now(repo, kind, number) returns it, and a card is stale when
its body does not already show it, as card.draw's own changed_only check decides (#347).
