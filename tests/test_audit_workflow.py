"""Tests for #285: one workflow runs the drift audit daily and on Run workflow.

The audit itself (`python3 -m dokima.audit OWNER/REPO`, #283) is proven in tests/test_audit.py and
tests/test_audit_cli.py. These prove the workflow that runs it: `.github/workflows/audit.yml`, read with the repo's
own YAML reader (tests/test_start.py's load_yaml, no YAML library). The workflow's own audit step is run the way GitHub
would run it: its `${{ }}` filled in, its env set, its script run with `bash -e` against the fake `gh` of
tests/fake_gh.py, from a folder holding .github/CODEOWNERS, with the dokima package on PYTHONPATH.
