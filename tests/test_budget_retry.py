"""Board and card updates the API budget stopped run again once it is back (#429).

On 2026-10-09 the Dokima app's GraphQL budget hit zero at about 22:10Z and reset at 22:29Z. Board and card runs that
fell in that window failed, and #330 and PR #327 stayed in the wrong columns until a comment forced a redraw. Now
every board update (board.yml's event runs and 15-minute sweeps, and the board step at the end of an agent run) and
every card update (card.yml's redraws and sweeps) that fails while a budget is empty waits for GitHub's reported reset
time, then runs once more from scratch, so its cards show the state on GitHub then. Any other failure fails as today.

The code under test is reached through three seams in dokima/retry.py, which every update must call through the
module, so a test can replace them:
    retry.rate_limit()  GitHub's `GET /rate_limit` answer as JSON ({"resources": {"core": {...}, "graphql": {...}}});
                        raises subprocess.CalledProcessError when GitHub refuses.
    retry.sleep(s)      waits s seconds.
    retry.now()         the time now, in epoch seconds.
Budget below fakes all three on one clock: a budget is empty until its reset time, and GitHub refuses the reads the
test names while any budget is empty, with GitHub's own words ("API rate limit already exceeded"). time.sleep is
made to fail, so a real wait can never hang the suite. The board is test_needs_you's in-memory world, as in
tests/test_board_state.py; the card's own drawing and sweep are faked at card.draw and card.sweep, which card.main calls.
