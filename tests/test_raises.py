"""Three kinds of raise and one table of who raises to whom (#298).

The owner wants every judgment an agent raises to be a question, a blocker or an issue, sent only where a fixed table
in code allows, stamped by code with who raised it and an ID, and answered by whoever it was sent to. This story adds
that shared model alone, in dokima/raises.py; no hand-back, card or prompt changes yet (story 3, #300, wires it in).

The module these tests run, as the plan fixes it:
- `KINDS`: the tuple ("question", "blocker", "issue").
- `TABLE`: a read-only mapping from each raiser to the tuple of whom it may send a question or blocker:
  planner -> owner; worker -> planner; reviewer -> planner, worker, owner. An issue is for no one.
- `check_raises(role, raises)`: the problems with the raises an agent of that role wrote, as plain sentences; empty
  when they are fine. A raise is {"kind", "to", "label", "text", "evidence"}; label and evidence are optional and an
  issue has no "to".
- `sent_to(raise_)`: the one who must answer a raise first: its "to", except the reviewer for a worker's raise to the
  planner (it goes through the reviewer); None for an issue.
- `stamp(role, raises, taken)`: copies of the raises with "raised_by" set to the role and an "id" unique among
  `taken` (the IDs already on the issue) and each other.
- `check_answers(role, answers, open_raises)`: the problems with an agent's answers, each {"raise": ID, "answer":
  "done" or "disagree", "why": text}, given the stamped raises still open on the issue; empty when they are fine.

Each test imports the module through `raises_module()`, so today every test fails saying the module is missing.
