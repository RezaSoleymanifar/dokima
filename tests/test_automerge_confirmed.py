"""Autopilot says it merged a pull request only once GitHub reports it merged (#412).

With a merge queue, or branch protection that waits on the owner's approval, `gh pr merge --squash` only puts the pull
request in the queue, or turns on auto-merge, and exits 0 with nothing merged. Autopilot used to post
`Autopilot: merged PR #N` on that exit code alone, so the issue said merged while its card said Needs you.

These tests run the code review (agent.yml) and `/autopilot start` (commands.yml) the way test_automerge.py does, on its
fake GitHub, taught three more ways a merge can go. A pull request in prs.json may carry "accepts":
  - "queue": `gh pr merge` with a method exits 0 saying the pull request was added to the merge queue; it stays open,
    and GitHub then reports isInMergeQueue true, autoMergeRequest set and reviewDecision APPROVED (`gh pr view --json`),
    and auto_merge set with merged false (`gh api repos/o/r/pulls/N`);
  - "approval": `gh pr merge` exits 0 saying it will be merged when all requirements are met; it stays open, out of the
    queue, with autoMergeRequest set and reviewDecision REVIEW_REQUIRED;
  - "silent": `gh pr merge` exits 0 and nothing changes: open, out of the queue, no auto-merge, no review required.
Asked through `gh api -X PUT repos/o/r/pulls/N/merge`, such a pull request is refused as GitHub refuses it (405). With
"unreadable" set too, once a merge was asked GitHub fails every read of that pull request (`gh pr view`,
`gh api repos/o/r/pulls/N`, `gh pr list`) with "HTTP 502: Bad Gateway". A pull request without "accepts" merges as in
test_automerge.py, and GitHub then reports it MERGED.

The issue card and the board work the river's state out again from the issue's history (dokima.card.status and
dokima.agent.waits_on_owner); those are run directly on a conversation as test_card_status.py builds it.
