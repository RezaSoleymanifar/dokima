"""AGENTS.md tells every session, human or agent, where the owner's specs go.

Issue #336 asks for a short rule with an example in AGENTS.md: every spec, answer or scope change lands on GitHub,
on an existing issue as a comment, an issue's original text stays frozen, and a new idea becomes a new issue. These
tests read the `## Where specs go` section of AGENTS.md and check each promise is written there, in plain words.
Matching ignores case, line breaks and repeated spaces, so the worker may wrap lines freely.
