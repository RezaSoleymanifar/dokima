"""Tests for #283: `python3 -m dokima.audit OWNER/REPO` audits the live repo through `gh`.

The in-memory tests in tests/test_audit.py prove what the audit decides. These prove it really reads and writes GitHub:
each runs the command from outside, the way a workflow does, with a fake `gh` (tests/fake_gh.py) first on PATH that
keeps GitHub in a JSON file and logs every call. The command is run from a folder holding .github/CODEOWNERS, with
DOKIMA_BOARD naming the org's board ("acme/1") and the dokima package on PYTHONPATH. The fake's docstring lists every
call it answers; any other call is logged as unsupported and refused, and the failure message shows it.

How the command is expected to read GitHub:
    labels              gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels
    board fields, views gh api graphql, organization(login:){projectV2(number:){fields views}}
    main's rule         gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/main/protection (404 "Branch not protected": no rule)
    the app's permissions  gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/installation, its "permissions"
and to write only the Setup issue: open, edit, comment, close and pin it (gh api or gh issue), and mark its card Needs
you through GraphQL (addProjectV2ItemById, then updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue on the Action field).
