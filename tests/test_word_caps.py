"""The planner check caps criteria and docstrings; a little over never fails a run.

Issue #239 (story 1 of #229). The owner set the caps: 25 words for a criterion's first sentence, 15 words for the
first line of every docstring the planner adds in its tests. A text up to 20% over its cap (30 words for 25, 18 for 15)
passes, and the check lists it; a text past that is rejected, naming it and its word count. Every new test's docstring
names the criteria it proves by number, below its first line. Since #482 a criterion is capped on its whole text at
12 words with no slack (tests/test_whole_text_caps.py); the docstring caps here keep their 20% slack.

Every test here runs `python3 -m dokima.planner check 9 OUT` through planner.main, in the temp git repo of the `check`
fixture of tests/test_plan_check.py (issue #9, one older test at the start, the planner's tests on top). Each test
rewrites the planner's tests/test_jobs.py and plan.json there, runs the check, and reads back the exit code, the reason
saved for the issue, and what the check printed.
