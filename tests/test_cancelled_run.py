"""A cancelled run says so quietly, the owner is mentioned on a real rejection, and nothing restarts by itself (#188).

These tests run the agent workflow (.github/workflows/agent.yml) the way GitHub runs it, with the machine from
test_start.py, and cancel some runs part way, the way the Cancel button on the Actions page does: at the code-owner
gate (before the run's card is up), while the tools install (card up, no agent yet), while the agent works, and after
the agent's hand-back passed code's check. Other runs are not cancelled and end the usual ways: a hand-back code
rejects, a step that fails before the agent, and a blocking plan review that the river sends back to the planner.
Each scenario runs once per module and the tests read what it left on the fake GitHub: its comments, and every call
that could start a run.
