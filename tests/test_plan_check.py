"""The planner check (#154): only real plans, sources on this issue, named tests that exist under this plan's criteria.

Every test here runs the check the way the agent workflow runs it, `python3 -m dokima.planner check N OUT`, through
planner.main, inside a temp git repo that holds one older test at the starting commit and the planner's new tests on
top. A good plan passes (exit 0); each broken one fails (exit 1) and its reason, saved to OUT/rejected.txt for the
issue, is read back. GITHUB_REPOSITORY is set to o/r and the issue is #9, so this issue's link is
