"""Scope shows as code on one line; Out of scope, requirements and the owner's text fold.

Issue #373. The owner asked (2026-10-09) that on the issue and PR card the Scope lists its files as code fields,
`dokima/card.py`, all on one line instead of one line per file, and that the original issue text, the non-functional
requirements and Out of scope sit in folds, closed by default. Answering the plan's question (2026-10-10), the owner
added that the PR card also carries the original issue text in its own fold, so the issue and PR cards stay identical.

The card is drawn by dokima/card.py render (the same card on the issue and the PR, which card.pr_body saves on the PR);
the owner's text below the card's marker is kept by dokima/body.py redraw and saved by the card's main and the planner,
and card.pr_body(card, pr_body, ask) puts the same Original issue fold on the PR, between the card and its Closes line.
These tests draw the card from records the way tests/test_card_records.py does and redraw bodies the way
tests/test_body.py does, with GitHub faked by its recorder.
