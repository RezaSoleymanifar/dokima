"""Every card opens on one short sentence, and worker docstrings are capped too.

Issue #240 (story 2 of #229). The planner's, worker's and reviewer's summaries are each one sentence of at most 25
words; every docstring the worker adds or changes opens with a line of at most 15 words. As in story 1 (#239,
dokima/words.py), a text up to 20% over its cap (30 words for 25, 18 for 15) passes and is listed; one past that is
rejected, naming it and its word count. A summary with a second sentence is rejected however short it is.

The planner's tests run `python3 -m dokima.planner check 9 OUT` through the `check` fixture of tests/test_plan_check.py.
The worker's and reviewer's tests run the real command the workflow runs, `python3 -m dokima.agent check work|review
FILE PLAN N`, from a temp git repo whose base commit is PLANNER_BASE, as the workflow sets it for every run; the
worker's code there lives in app/, so nothing in the temp repo shadows Dokima's own package.
