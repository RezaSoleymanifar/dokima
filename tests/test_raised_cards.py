"""Cards show what was raised and how earlier raises were answered (#299).

The owner wants every judgment an agent raised (a question, a blocker or an issue, from dokima/raises.py) drawn in one
Raised section, each line with its kind's icon and who it is for, never with an ID; a review card shows what earlier
steps raised, with the reviewer's answer, apart from what this review raises. Records posted before this change are
never redrawn, and what code detects keeps its own place.

What the code these tests run must do, as the plan pins it:
- A record's hand-back may carry "raises": stamped raises {"kind", "to", "label", "text", "evidence", "raised_by",
  "id"} (an issue has no "to"), and "answers": {"raise": ID, "answer": "done" or "disagree", "why", and, for an
  answer given for the owner on autopilot, "words" and "source": the owner's words and where they said them}.
- `agent.render(rec, pr=None, plan=None, earlier=None)`: `earlier` is the issue's records before this one, oldest
  first; an answer finds the raise it answers there by its ID. The workflow's record step,
  `python3 -m dokima.agent record ROLE STAGE OUT CHECK PASSED LOGS`, passes the records in `$PACK/in/` as `earlier`.
- `card.render(repo, issue, found)`: the issue card lists no raises since #455; they stay in the comment that raised
  them, and tests/test_card_raises_status.py pins the card.
- A rejected hand-back's raises are not drawn: its comment and the issue card stay as today, showing why it was
  rejected.

How the tests read a card:
- A section is a heading line whose bold text is exactly "Raised:" (this run's raises) or "Raised earlier:" (what
  earlier steps raised, answered here), icons allowed in front, then its list: every line after the heading up to the
  first non-empty line that is neither a list item ("- ") nor indented under one. An item is a "- " line with the
  indented lines under it.
- A raise's line opens, right after "- ", with its kind's icon: the <img> of card.field_icon for "question",
  "blocker" or "issue found". It holds the label when there is one, the text, and exactly one of: "for you", "for the
  planner", "for the worker", "filed as an issue".
- An answer's item holds "Done" or "Disagree" and the why; an answer given for the owner on autopilot also holds a
  markdown link whose text holds the owner's words and whose target is where they said them.
- The full record fold, "<details><summary>Full record</summary>...</details>", is the record itself and is not
  read as the card.

The golden files in tests/raised_goldens/ are what today's code draws for records posted before this change and for
what code detects (a rejected hand-back, a clash with main, red main, a failed merge of main, a cancelled run, and the
issue card of failing tests); they must stay byte for byte the same.
