"""Every change on an issue or its PR redraws its card, from card.yml alone (#438).

Story 2 of #425, re-planned as one story of three criteria.

#419: the code review had passed, yet the card said Code review running for 30 minutes. card.yml picked its moments:
it skipped the bot's own edits and comments (except a code review's run card on a pull request) and redrew on a run's
start only for the full suite. The review's record is the bot's edit of its run card, so nothing redrew. Beside
card.yml, the old planner (dokima/planner.py, `post`) saved its own plan above the marker, and the plan approval
(`python3 -m dokima.agent next`, dokima/agent.py record_links) drew the cards of the issues its links touched. The
play-through (.github/workflows/playthrough.yml) ran only from the Run workflow button.

These tests play card.yml one event at a time on the fake GitHub of tests/card_player.py, run the old planner's post
and the plan approval against fakes, read .github/workflows/playthrough.yml, and run `python3 -m dokima.playthrough`
with a temp git repo standing in for a pull request. Nothing calls real GitHub.
