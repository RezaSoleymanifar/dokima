"""The board's Blocker pill is computed from blocked-by links, never set by hand (#294).

An open issue that blocks at least one other open issue shows Priority Blocker. The board sync recomputes it when an
issue closes or reopens and on a schedule every 15 minutes (GitHub starts no workflow when a link is added or removed),
and the blocker label no longer moves the pill. Without Blocker, the pill follows the high or parked label as before.

Most tests fake dokima.board.Board itself and read the board's end state. What the fake Board offers, and the code is
expected to use (the first group exists today; the second is new):
    Board(spec, repo, q, rest)          the board
    .fields                             {"Status": ..., "Action": ..., "Priority": (id, {option: id})}
    .item(kind, n) / .set(item, field, option or None) / .value(item, field)
    .autopilot(kind, n) / .open_pr(n) / .parent(n) / .label(kind, n, on) / .views() / .add_view(...)

    .blocking(n) -> [{"number", "state"}]     the issues n blocks, each with its state ("open" or "closed")
    .blocked_by(n) -> [{"number", "state"}]   the issues blocking n, each with its state
    .open_issues() -> [n, ...]                every open issue of the repo, pull requests left out
    .labels(kind, n) -> {name, ...}           the labels the issue carries

The new reads raise subprocess.CalledProcessError when GitHub refuses, as Board's REST calls do today. The last tests
run the real Board against a faked GitHub, so those reads truly reach GitHub's issue dependencies API
(repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/dependencies/blocking and .../blocked_by, the same API dokima/agent.py reads).
