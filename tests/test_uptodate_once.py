"""A PR that cannot be updated with main carries one comment, edited in place (#408).

After every merge to main, `dokima.uptodate.run(repo, base, sha, rest=...)` tries GitHub's Update branch on every open
PR behind main. Before #408, every refusal posted a new "could not be updated" comment, so PR #287 got 23 identical
ones in a day. These tests fake GitHub through the same `rest(method, path, **fields)` seam as tests/test_uptodate.py,
but keep each PR's comments as GitHub would, so several merges in a row can be run against one PR and the comments it
ends up carrying can be counted. One test runs the real module from outside against a fake `gh` on PATH.

The fake GitHub answers:
  - GET .../pulls: the open PRs; GET .../compare/BASE...HEAD: behind by one commit;
  - PUT .../pulls/N/update-branch: 202, or 422 with GitHub's refusal for that PR (set per run in `refuse`);
  - GET .../issues/N/comments (paged with page=): the PR's comments as REST returns them, oldest first;
  - POST .../issues/N/comments, PATCH .../issues/comments/ID, DELETE .../issues/comments/ID.
