"""Each issue's card redraws wait in their own queue, never cancelling another issue's (#346).

All card redraws used to share one queue (card.yml's single concurrency group `card`), and GitHub keeps only one waiting
run per queue: a redraw for one issue waiting there was dropped when a redraw for another issue arrived, which is how
#312's card missed its update. Now an issue and its pull request share one queue that keeps the newest redraw, and two
issues never share one.

These tests play card.yml for one event at a time against a fake GitHub, with tests/card_player.py (the player #332's
planner wrote on branch try/issue-332), and read the concurrency groups every run took a place in. The events are the
ones card.yml redraws on today: the issue changing or getting a comment, the pull request merged, the checks of the pull
request finishing (Acceptance criteria and full suite), and the worker finishing.
