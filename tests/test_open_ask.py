"""The owner's folded text is never changed by a redraw, nor read as the plan.

Issue #237, story 4 of #230, opened the owner's ask below the card; issue #373 folds every ask again under a closed
`<details><summary>Original issue</summary>` (tests/test_card_folds.py proves that). What #237 kept still holds: an
issue whose body is a split's story, quoted by code from the parent's approved plan (dokima/agent.py story_body),
keeps the fold; a redraw that would change the owner's text is refused, leaving the body as it was and saying why on
the issue; and the owner's old checkboxes are never read as the plan.

GitHub is faked by the same recorder tests/test_body.py uses; the card's main runs as in those tests.
