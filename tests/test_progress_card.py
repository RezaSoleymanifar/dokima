"""The run's live card shows coarse stages, set only by the run's own steps before and after the agent (#187).

The owner asked for no ticking minutes, no second job and no key on the agent's machine. So the card goes through
queued, setting up, agent working since HH:MM UTC, checking, and done (the run's record), each written by a step of the
run itself, and while the agent works it links to the run's live page on GitHub for detail.

These tests run the agent workflow (.github/workflows/agent.yml) the way GitHub runs it, with the machine from
test_start.py: a fake GitHub that keeps every version of every comment and which key made each call, and a fake
Claude Code that notes what GitHub showed when it started. To see the card at two moments of the run, each test run
also notes what GitHub showed when the step 'Install pytest and Claude Code' starts and when the step 'Code checks
the hand-back' starts (the test adds one line to the start of each step's script; the real workflow is unchanged).
Those two steps keep their names.

A card's stage is read from its first line, as the live card writes it today: `<icon> **Role** · <stage>`.
