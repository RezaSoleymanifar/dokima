"""A new issue shows the owner's text open until planned, then folded under Original issue.

Issue #407. #237 promised the owner's ask reads open on the issue they wrote; #373 then folded the owner's text on
every card and #371 put the Definition of Done below that fold, so a brand-new issue showed only a closed "Original
issue" fold and the Definition of Done. The owner asked (2026-10-09) that until an issue has a plan, its original text
shows open, read first, with the Definition of Done below it; once a plan exists the text moves into its Original
issue fold, as today.

A split's sub-issue is not the owner's own text: code quotes it from the parent's approved plan, and #237 (237.3)
decided it stays folded. It keeps its fold here too.

The card is drawn by dokima/card.py render and saved by card.draw through dokima/body.py. These tests run card.draw
with GitHub faked by the recorder in tests/test_body.py (via the helpers of tests/test_new_issue_card.py) and read the
body it saves the way the owner reads the issue.
