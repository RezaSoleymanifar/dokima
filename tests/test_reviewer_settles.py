"""The reviewer settles raises between agents and confirms issues before code files them (#301).

Story 4 of #289. A worker's raise for the planner ("this test is broken") goes to the reviewer first. When the reviewer
answers it done, the planner starts with it as the reviewer's blocker; when the reviewer answers it disagree, the worker
starts again with the reviewer's why. Neither waits for the owner, and on autopilot neither merges the pull request.

An issue raise (a real problem outside this issue) becomes its own GitHub issue only once the reviewer confirms it: the
reviewer's own issue raises count as confirmed and are filed in its run, and its record says so; the planner's or the
worker's are listed for the reviewer's next run, filed when it answers done and never when it answers disagree, and
never in the planner's or worker's own run. Filing is done by `python3 -m dokima.agent next N OUT`, the step of
agent.yml that runs after the agent finished, holds the app's key and finishes the run's record (OUT/comment.md). An
issue GitHub refuses to file is named on the record with GitHub's reason, and the record and the river still stand.

The river tests call `agent.next_step` and `agent.raises_for` (what the pack writes to open_blockers.json) on records
built here. The filing tests run the real `agent next` as a subprocess against a fake GitHub: a `gh` program put first
on PATH that keeps its state in one JSON file and logs every call. It answers:
  - `gh issue view N [--json ...]`, `gh issue comment N --body/--body-file`, `gh pr list` (always none);
  - `gh issue create --title/-t T --body/-b B | --body-file/-F F [--label/-l L ...]`, printing the new issue's URL;
  - `gh issue list [...]` and `gh api repos/o/r/issues[?...]` (GET), listing every issue;
  - `gh api [-X POST] repos/o/r/issues -f title=.. -f body=.. [-f labels[]=..]` (or -F body=@file, or --input file),
    answering the new issue as GitHub's REST API does;
  - `gh api repos/o/r/issues/N` (GET), `gh api repos/o/r/issues/N/comments` (GET or POST body=),
    `gh api search/issues?...` (no hits), `gh api repos/o/r/labels[...]` and `gh label create`, which always succeed;
  - with "refuse" set in its state, every new issue is refused with that GitHub message on stderr and exit 1.
New issues are numbered from 500. Any other call fails, the way an unknown GitHub path does.
