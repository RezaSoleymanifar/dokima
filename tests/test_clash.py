"""A clash with main goes to the planner, on the record (#190).

After a merge to main, `dokima.uptodate.run(repo, base, sha, rest=..., on_clash=...)` calls `on_clash(pr, sha)` for
every PR GitHub refuses to update with a merge conflict (#189). This story fills that hook with
`dokima.uptodate.clash(repo, base, sha, pr, rest=api, files=None, owners=None)`, and `python3 -m dokima.uptodate`
wires it in:
  - `pr` is the PR as GitHub lists it; `sha` is the merge on main (the push's head sha);
  - `files(pr, sha)` returns the paths that clashed; by default a trial merge in the git checkout the module runs in,
    fetching what it needs from its `origin` remote;
  - `owners` are the code owners' logins; by default those of the checkout's CODEOWNERS;
  - every GitHub call goes through `rest(method, path, **fields)`, shaped like `dokima.board.api`.

A Dokima PR is one whose branch is try/issue-N in this same repo. Its clash leaves a record on issue N (a bot comment
carrying agent.MARK with the JSON record folded below, role "updater") and starts the planner for N with the river's
own `dokima-next` signal, unless a clash record is already waiting for its planner. Any other PR gets a comment that
mentions the owners and starts nothing.

The worker side runs the real steps of .github/workflows/agent.yml on the machine from test_start.py: a temp origin
where main and try/issue-57 clash, the worker's edits, the fence and the push.

The fake GitHub (in-process) answers:
  - GET repos/o/r/commits/SHA/pulls: the PRs that merge brought in;
  - GET repos/o/r/issues/N/comments (any query; empty past page 1): the issue's comments, REST-shaped;
  - GET repos/o/r/pulls/N: the PR;
  - GET repos/o/r/issues/N: the issue with its labels, the `autopilot` label by default (#369), or GitHub's refusal;
  - POST repos/o/r/issues/N/comments (body): a new comment, kept;
  - POST repos/o/r/dispatches (event_type, client_payload as a dict or as client_payload[key] fields).
