"""The planner check on a re-plan (#201): a new test must fail on main's code, not on the branch's.

On a re-plan the issue's branch may already hold the worker's code, so a new test that proves that code passes on the
branch even though the feature is missing on main. Every test here runs `python3 -m dokima.planner check 9 OUT`
through planner.main, inside the temp git repo of the `check` fixture of tests/test_plan_check.py, set up like a real
re-plan: main is the fixture's starting commit (PLANNER_BASE), the branch adds the planner's first-round test and then
the worker's code (jobs.py, at PLANNER_RUN_BASE), and the re-plan writes its tests on top.
