"""The planner check (#155): new tests need a one-sentence summary and must fail today; a rename is a change.

Every test here runs `python3 -m dokima.planner check 9 OUT` through planner.main, inside the temp git repo of the

good story STORY, which names tests/test_jobs.py::test_id and ::test_unique. Each test rewrites the planner's files in
that repo, runs the check, and reads back the exit code and the reason saved for the issue.
