"""The board's column and pills are always computed from the issue's state right now (#331).

Before this, each board update trusted the one event that started it: board.decide() mapped each event to a column,
agent.move_card() put the card where the finished run said, and a dropped, late or out-of-order event left a card
wrong for good (#231 stuck in Work, about 40 closed cards still showing a pill). Now every event about an issue or its
pull request, the end of every agent run and a sweep every 15 minutes set the cards from GitHub as it is.

The rule these tests hold the board to, for an issue and the pull requests built for it:
- closed issue, merged or closed pull request: Done, no Action pill, whatever its labels;
- open issue with no agent record yet: Backlog;
- otherwise the column the river placed it in after its newest record (agent.board_place on that record and the
  river's next step: the stage now running, or the stage that stopped for the owner; a filed split is Work);
- Needs you while the issue waits on the owner (agent.waits_on_owner), else Autopilot while the item carries the
  autopilot label, else no pill. An open pull request goes with the issue it was built for.

Most tests run against test_needs_you's in-memory world: dokima.board.Board and agent's `gh` are faked, so the tests
read the board's end state. On top of that fake Board, cards() also gives each card's column:

    .cards() -> [{"kind", "number", "status", "action", "closed", "autopilot"}, ...]

and the history (the bot's records, everyone's words, pull request reviews) is read through `gh issue view`,
`gh pr list`, `gh pr view` and `gh api`, as agent.conversation does. A history entry that is a (login, words) pair is
a comment by that person; a plain string is the code owner's words.
