"""The board hears every review and line note, never through a PR's own keyed copy (#396).

GitHub runs a workflow triggered by pull_request, pull_request_review, pull_request_review_comment, push to a branch
or workflow_dispatch from the copy of the workflow file on that branch or pull request, so a pull request that edits
board.yml would change how its own board run behaves while that run holds the keys environment. Only issues,
issue_comment, schedule, pull_request_target and workflow_run always run the default branch's copy.

So board.yml runs only on those, and a review or a line note reaches it in two steps: a keyless workflow (the relay)
runs on the review or line note, and board.yml runs, as main's copy and with the keys, when that relay finishes
(workflow_run). The relay may be the pull request's own copy, so it must hold no key at all.

These tests read the workflow files without a YAML library, and run dokima.board on the workflow_run event GitHub
sends when the relay finishes, against test_needs_you's in-memory world.
