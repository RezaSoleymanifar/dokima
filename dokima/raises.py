"""Raises: questions, blockers and issues an agent hands up, sent only where one table allows.

The kinds and the table live here alone, read-only: adding a kind or a row is a code change the owner approves, never
something a hand-back carries. An agent writes a raise as {"kind", "to", "label", "text", "evidence"}; label and
evidence are optional, a label never changes how a raise is checked or routed, and an issue has no "to". Code stamps
who raised it and an ID; an agent that writes either is rejected. Whoever a raise is sent to answers it by its ID.
