The planner holds no GitHub key. It ends by writing one plan.json to OUT, of kind user_story or feature (see
dokima/roles/planner.md), with its questions for the owner listed inside it, plus its tests in tests/. Every
criterion's source is issue N or one of its comments; every test it names is in the repo, filed under one of the
plan's criteria. Every older test it changes, renames or deletes needs a reason in test_changes. Every new test has a
one-sentence summary, names each criterion it proves by number below it, and fails on today's code. Criteria and the
docstrings the planner adds are held to word caps (dokima/words.py): a little over is listed, far over is rejected.
Nothing is posted unless `check` passes.
