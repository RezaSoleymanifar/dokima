"""One play-through on the sandbox repo, judging both cards after every step (#437).

It plays a new issue to a merge.

    REPO=dokima-dev/card-gallery PLAYED=<folder> PLAYED_COMMIT=<sha> SANDBOX_TOKEN=... GH_TOKEN=... \
        python3 -m dokima.playthrough

Before the first step it installs the played commit on the sandbox: the dokima/ and .github/workflows/ files of the
PLAYED folder are pushed to the sandbox's default branch with SANDBOX_TOKEN, a key of the play-through's own that can
write only there, so the cards it judges are drawn by that commit's card.yml and dokima/card.py. Then it plays one
issue through STEPS. Stand-in agents call no model: each writes its role's hand-back and no model report, and the
played commit's own `dokima.agent record` turns it into the record posted on the sandbox. After each step it waits up
to PLAYTHROUGH_WAIT seconds for the sandbox's card runs, reads both cards and logs `PASS: <step>` or
`FAIL: <step>: ...` quoting what the wrong card showed. Every step is played even after one fails; the run exits 1
when any step failed, 0 when all passed. It refuses any repository but the sandbox before calling GitHub.
