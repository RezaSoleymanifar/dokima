"""Build the Dokima card and write it at the top of both the issue and its PR.

The card shows the plan's user story and criteria, each with GitHub's own verdict
from that criterion's check. It computes no verdicts itself: a pass appears only
when GitHub recorded the criterion's check as passed on the PR's latest commit.

It runs from the default branch, never from a PR's own code, so the work being
judged cannot change how it is reported. No AI writes the card. It is drawn only
from the agents' records and GitHub's checks and reviews, never from the issue's
text, so the issue and its PR show the same card.
