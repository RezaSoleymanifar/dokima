"""The fence: after the worker stops, only in-scope changes survive and the planner's tests are exactly as committed.

The judges (all tests, each criterion's check) run on fresh machines from what gets pushed, so nothing the worker does to
its own machine reaches them. What gets pushed is decided here, by code: every test file and test setup file is put back
to the build's starting commit, and every other change outside the plan's scope is undone. The dropped paths are listed
so the owner sees them.
