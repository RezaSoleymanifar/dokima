"""Name every card on the board that does not match its issue's state now (#333).

    DOKIMA_BOARD=org/number REPO=owner/name python3 -m dokima.scan

One line for each closed card outside Done or with a pill, each open card in the wrong column (or in none), each issue
or PR card that does not show the card Dokima draws for its issue now, and each card GitHub will not give, then exit 1.
When every card matches, it says so and exits 0. It only reads: it never moves a card, sets a pill or edits a body.
The column comes from dokima.board's rules and the card from dokima.card's, as they are.
