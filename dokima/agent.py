"""Packs and hand-back checks for running one agent by hand on a fresh machine.

`pack` builds the agent's starting pack from GitHub's records: the issue as it stands (body and every comment) and the
JSON hand-backs of earlier runs, downloaded from those runs. `check` is the deterministic check an agent runs on its own
hand-back before it finishes, and that code runs again after it: a malformed hand-back never reaches the next agent.
The plan's own check lives in dokima/planner.py; this module adds review.json and work.json.
