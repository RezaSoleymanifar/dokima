"""The issue body: code's card above one marker, the owner's ask below, never rewritten.

Once planned, every ask sits folded under Original issue (#373), with the card's Definition of Done after the fold, as
the body's last line (#454). While an issue has no plan, the owner's own ask shows open, with the card's Definition of
Done after it, after its own marker (#371, #407); a split's story, quoted by code from the parent's approved plan,
stays folded with the Definition of Done after the fold (#237). Reading accepts every layout, and the next redraw
moves the ask to the one its card calls for.

Every code path that redraws an issue body (the card and the planner) saves it through `save`, which keeps the
owner's part byte for byte or refuses, leaves the body as it was and says why in a comment on the issue.
